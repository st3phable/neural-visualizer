A responsive UI component that simulates neural network activity. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Features include:
- Real-time state updates using setInterval and React Hooks.
- Responsive grid layout handling dynamic array resizing.
- Custom "glassmorphism" UI design with interactive sliders for gain/threshold control.

This project visualizes the stochastic firing patterns of a simplified neural circuit. It models the competition between Dopaminergic gain (signal amplification) and GABAergic inhibition (firing thresholds). The visualizer dynamically renders states of Homeostasis, Mania (Hyper-activity), and Sedation (Hypo-activity) based on user-controlled neurotransmitter parameters.
